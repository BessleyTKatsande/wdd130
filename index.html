<h2>Bessley Tawanda Katsande</h2>
<p>Hello my name is Bessley. I'm from Zimbabwe but currently stay in Cape Town South Afrcia. I was lucky enough to grow up in Indonesia where my family and I joined the church. Several years later I was able to serve a mission in Durban during the pandemic. It was frustrating because we had to deal with lockdowns but the work continued regardless.</p>
<p>Afterwards I did BYU online and my bachelors is in applied technology. Despite this I often do courses that are outside my major because I like learning new skills. I also like the convenience that BYU online offers me. My hobbies include drawing, reading, exercising, cooking, and practising martial arts.</p>
